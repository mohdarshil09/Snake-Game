 • The Snake Game is implemented using Java Swing, featuring a simple GUI with a black background where players
 control the snake using arrow keys to eat apples and grow in length.
 • The game checks for collisions with walls and the snake’s own body, ending the game if a collision occurs, and displays a
 ”Game Over” message.
 • The snake’s movement is managed using a timer, which continuously updates its position, and the game generates apples
 at random positions for the snake to eat, increasing its length when consumed.
 • The game initializes with a starting length of three segments, and players can control the direction of the snake (up,
 down, left, right) while it moves automatically, creating an engaging and challenging gameplay experience.
